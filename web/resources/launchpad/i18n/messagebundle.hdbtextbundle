SHINE_INTRO=SAP HANA Interactive Education, or SHINE, is a demo application that makes it easy to learn how to build applications on SAP HANA Extended Application Services Advanced Model. This demo application is delivered as a package which contains sample data and design-time developer objects for the applications database tables, views, OData and user interface.
SHINE_WHATS_NEW=<ul><li>Unit tests for tables,views,functions,procedures in Node.js </li><li>SecureStore in Node.js</li></ul>
SHINE_WHATS_NEW_1.6.1=<ul><li>SQL Script Enhancements </li><li>Nodejs Enhancements</li><li>SAP UI5 service Broker</li></ul>
SHINE_WHATS_NEW_1.1.12=<ul><li>Micro services based architecture</li><li>XSOData service from a node based XSJS library</li><li>All database artifacts using HDI</li></ul>
SHINE_WHATS_NEW_PREV=<ul><li>ETags and Null values in XSOData</li><li>Migration from $.db to $.hdb and XSDS in services</li><li>XSJS features - Multipart Message handling, Text Access API, XML parsing</li><li>Table type definition in Procedures</li></ul>

TILE_DESC_DG=<div>The demo application defines a set of tables, along with a basic set of initial data that comes in a set of CSV files. For example, the sales orders table begins with 1,000 records. </br><ul><li>This application provides the tools for generating additional sales and purchase order records, as well as reloading the master data tables.</li><li>The complete application data can also be reset using this module.</li></ul></div>
TILE_DESC_PO=<div>This UI illustrates a comprehensive Purchase Order Worklist which can act as a complete interface for a Purchase Department Head.</br><ul><li>There is a list of Purchase Orders and upon selection of a particular order, the general data and Purchase Order items related to the purchase order are listed in separate tabs.</li><li>He can perform Actions like Delete, Accept or Reject on these Purchase Orders and export the data to excel</li><li>He can perform search for the Purchase Orders based on different attribute like Company Name,Product ID,etc</li></ul></div>
TILE_DESC_SO=<div>This UI illustrates a Sales Order Worklist where you can create and delete Sales Orders.</br><ul><li>The Details tab provides a type of PO Worklist where all the Sales Orders are listed.</li><li>By selecting a Sales Order, you can view its details.</li><li>This tab also provides a feature for creating Sales Orders using XSJS.</li></ul></div>
TILE_DESC_SD=<div>This UI illustrates a comprehensive dashboard concept for a Sales Manager that contains several charts based on the OData models constructed in the demo content.</br><ul><li>The Overview tab contains all the sales specific charts based on Region/Country/Discount per region.</li><li>The Product Reports tab contains charts that provide sales information categorized by product.</li><li>The Details tab provides a type of PO Worklist where all the Sales Orders are listed.</li><li>By selecting a Sales Order, you can view its details.</li><li>This tab also provides a feature for creating Sales Orders using XSJS.</li></ul></div>
TILE_DESC_US=<div>The userCRUD ( Create Read Update Delete) folder contains a simple model and UI demonstrating creation and update of data.</br><ul><li>User CRUD has two server-side implementations - Node.js and Java. The switch on the top of the screen can be used to toggle between the two server-side implementations which share the same user interface.</li><li>Here in this screen, a new User record can be created as well as existing records can be updated in the table itself or deleted.</li><li>New records can be created using two methods, first by <b>simple HTTP POST request using OData</b> and second by using the <b>$batch request provided by OData</b> which allows us to create multiple records in a single HTTP request.</li><li>You can perform an update by modifying the First Name, Last Name, and/or Email fields that already exist in the table.</li><li>This UI also showcases how to integrate the custom exits for OData methods.</li></ul></div>
TILE_DESC_UIS_BLUE=<div>SAP HANA UI integration services act as a container for mini web pages. Rather than developing an entire site with dependencies between the various components, you develop small chunks of functions called widgets. Widgets are added in an application site container where they are consumed to build your final web site.</br></br>This UI Shows the Blue Crystal Runtime of the Site.</div>
TILE_DESC_UIS_GOLD=<div>SAP HANA UI integration services act as a container for mini web pages. Rather than developing an entire site with dependencies between the various components, you develop small chunks of functions called widgets. Widgets are added in an application site container where they are consumed to build your final web site.</br></br>This UI Shows the Gold Reflection Runtime of the Site.</div>
TILE_DESC_SPATIAL=<div>This UI illustrates a small demo on how spatial features and analyisis can be integrated with HANA XS applications. In this UI we use the latitude and longitude data from Address table to perform analysis over Sales and Customer data.</div>
TILE_DESC_INATOOLKIT=<div>SAP Search UI on HANA provides an easy way to perform full text search on content stored in tables or exposed via views.Just like searching on the Internet, full-text search finds terms irrespective of the sequence of characters and words.Here the search is performed on the Product categories and also on the business partners.</br></div>
TILE_DESC_SALES_MOBILE=<div>This Mobile UI illustrates a comprehensive dashboard concept that contains several charts based on the OData model constructed in the demo content. You can see  sales specific charts based on Region/Country/Discount per region and  charts that provide sales information categorized by product.</div>
TILE_DESC_FIORI=<div>SAP Fiori launchpad is the entry point to Fiori apps on mobile or desktop devices.</br>First of all, the launchpad displays various tiles. Tiles are rectangular objects that provide access to applications. Which tiles are displayed on a userâ€™s entry page depends on the userâ€™s role. Depending on the role, the user can choose from a wide choice of ready-to-use tiles from the tile catalog as part of the launchpad personalization.</div>
TILE_DESC_XSDS=<div>XS Data Services (XSDS) are a native JavaScript CDS client and query builder for the XS engine to consume HANA-based records as native JavaScript objects. This UI illustrates how a sales order with multiple items can be created using XSDS query builder. In future versions of SHINE all XSJS scripts will be modified to use XSDS.</div>
TILE_DESC_XSUNT=<div>XSUnit enables automated testing of HANA XS Application content as well as database content in a convenient and isolated way.The XSUnit test framework is a custom version of the JavaScript Test framework Jasmine adapted to the XS Engine. In XSUnit you can test:<ul><li>Server side JavaScript code</li><li>SQLScript code (Stored Procedures, Views)</li><li>Modelled Calculation Views</li></ul><div>As a prerequisite the delivery unit HANA_TEST_TOOLS have to be imported which can be download from,<a target='_blank' href='https://websmp101.sap-ag.de/patches'>https://websmp101.sap-ag.de/patches</a>: Support Packages and Patches => H => SAP HANA PLATFORM EDITION => SAP HANA PLATFORM EDIT. 1.0 => Entry by component => HANA Test Tools</div></div>
TILE_DESC_UI5SEARCH=<div>This example demonstrates how to define a search model with Core Data Services (CDS) and how to use SAPUI5 to build a search UI, leveraging the OData interface. In order to run full-text search queries, full-text indexes are defined on tables containing product related data, using CDS</div>
TILE_DESC_JOBSCHEDULING=<div>This example demonstrates how to use the XSA Job Scheduler to create Job and Schedule. Created Jobs can also be deleted via this UI. And these features were enabled using XSA Job Scheduler Service</div>
TILE_DESC_ETAGSXSODATA=<div>This example demonstrates how to use ETags in XSOData and Null values for Entity properties in XSOData</div>
